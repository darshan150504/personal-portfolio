### Getting Started with Create React App
This project was my first live project.


## Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install all the dependencies on your PC:
`npm install`

2. Start the development server:
`npm start`

 Your app will be running on port 3000. Open [http://localhost:3000] in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and any errors will be displayed in the console.


## Testing
To run tests, use the following command:
`npm test`

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.


## Building for Production
To build the app for production, use:
`npm run build`

This command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and filenames include hashes. Your app will be ready to be deployed.
